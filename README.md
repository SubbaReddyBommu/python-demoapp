## Building & Running Locally

### Pre-reqs

- Be using Linux, WSL or MacOS, with bash, make etc
- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - for running locally, linting, running tests etc
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - for running as a container, or image build and push

Clone the project to any directory where you do development work

```
git clone https://github.com/marios-r/python-demoapp.git
```

### Makefile

A standard GNU Make file is provided to help with running and building locally.

```text
help                 üí¨ This help message
lint                 üîé Lint & format, will not fix but sets exit code on error
lint-fix             üìú Lint & format, will try to fix errors and modify code
image                üî® Build container image from Dockerfile
push                 üì§ Push container image to registry
run                  üèÉ Run the server locally using Python & Flask
test                 üéØ Unit tests for Flask app
test-report          üéØ Unit tests for Flask app (with report output)
test-api             üö¶ Run integration API tests, server must be running
clean                üßπ Clean up project
```

Make file variables and default values, pass these in when calling `make`, e.g. `make image IMAGE_REPO=blah/foo`

| Makefile Variable | Default                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| TEST_HOST         | localhost:5008            |
| IMAGE_REPO        | m219raptis/python-demoapp |
| IMAGE_TAG         | latest                    |

The app runs under Flask and listens on port 5000 by default, this can be changed with the `PORT` environmental variable.

# Containers

Public container image is [available on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/m219raptis/python-demoapp)

Run in a container with:

```bash
docker container run -dp 5008:5008 -t m219raptis/python-demoapp:latest
```

Should you want to build your own container, use `make image` and the above variables to customise the name & tag.

# GitHub Actions CI/CD

A working set of CI and CD release GitHub Actions workflows are provided `.github/workflows/`, automated builds are run in GitHub hosted runners.

It is assumed that PRs are deployed on a QA enironment and master is deployed on a staging environment.

In the case you fork this repo, please note that there are some secret variables you need to add.
| Secret Variable | Description                                                             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| D_REG_USER      | Docker Hub username                                                     |
| D_REG_PW        | Docker Hub password                                                     |
| D_SSH_KEY       | SSH private key to deployment server                                    |
| D_SSH_USER      | Username too login with SSH                                             |
| GHA_TOKEN       | GitHub token with permission to access your repo (public if it's public)|

Additionally, you need to add the below repository variables.
| Variable     | Description                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| QA_HOST      | Host for the QA deployment (domain|ip)                 |
| QA_PORT      | Port where the deployed app can be accessed on QA      |
| STAGING_HOST | Host for the staging deployment (domain|ip)            |
| STAGING_PORT | Port where the deployed app can be accessed on staging |
